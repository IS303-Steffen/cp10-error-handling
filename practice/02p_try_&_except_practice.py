# =====================
# TRY / EXCEPT PRACTICE
# =====================




# 1. PRACTICE:
# write a function that takes two parameters, each an integer,
# divides the first by the second number, and returns the result.
# print out the result that is returned.

# Call the function, but enter a 0 as the second argument.
# Catch the exception and print out "You cannot divide by zero."

# Make it so "thank you for using the program" prints out regardless of
# whether the error was triggered or not.
